Loss means any and all amounts for which the Insurer is liable to the Insured under the terms and conditions of this Policy. For the avoidance of doubt Insurers shall be liable to pay as Loss all damages, costs, claims and other expenses of the Insured that are covered under the Primary Policy. The liability of the Insurer for costs and/or expenses of any kind shall be part of and not in addition to the Limit of Liability as set out in Item 4 of the Schedule.

- 1. Policy Period means the period designated in Item 3 of the Schedule.
  2. Primary Policy means the policy designated as the Primary Policy in Item 5 (a) of the Schedule.
  3. Excess policy(ies) means all policies listed in Item 5 (b) of the Schedule.
  4. Underlying Policies means the Primary Policy and the Excess Policies listed in Items 5(a) and 5(b) of the Schedule.

1. Insuring Agreement

In consideration of the payment of the premium and subject always to the terms and conditions of this Policy, the Insurer and the Insured agree as follows:

- 1. The Insurer will provide the Insured coverage for Loss up to the Limit of Liability mentioned in Item 4 of the Schedule, in excess of the limits of liability of the Underlying Policies and in accordance with the same terms, conditions and endorsements of the Primary Policy, except as otherwise provided in this Policy.
  2. Subject to paragraph 2.3, below, liability to make a payment for any Loss under this Policy will not attach unless and until the insurers of the Underlying Policies have paid, agreed to pay or been held liable to pay as a result of a judgment the full amount of their limit of indemnity as set out in Item 5(a)/5(b) of the Schedule, inclusive of interest and costs.
  3. Liability under paragraph 2.2, above, is subject to the following:
     1. Where for any reason any of the insurers of the Primary Policy or the Excess Policy(ies) do not pay loss forming part of the total limits of liability of the Underlying Polic(ies) and such unpaid amount is paid by or on behalf of the Insured, the Insurer will recognise the erosion of the limit of liability applicable to any Loss as a consequence of such payment.
     2. If by reason of the payment of any losses under the Primary Policy or the Excess Policy(ies) during the Policy Period, the amount of indemnity provided by the Primary Policy and the Excess Policy is
        1. partially reduced, then this Policy shall apply in excess of the reduced amount of the Underlying Policies for the remainder of the Policy Period; or
        2. totally exhausted, then this Policy shall continue in force as Primary Policy until expiry or exhaustion.
     3. Where, as part of any agreement to pay loss under an Underlying Policy, an insurer agrees to pay less than the total limit of liability for that policy and that payment is considered full payment of such loss, the Insurer will pay that loss as Loss under this Policy as if the limit of liability of the Underlying Policy(ies) had been eroded in full. However, to the extent that the Insurer is required to contribute to the loss referred to in the sentence above,

the Insurer will only pay as Loss that amount in excess of the total limit of liability of the Underlying Policy(ies) and only in the same proportion of the whole limit of liability as paid by the Underlying Policy, unless otherwise agreed.

- - 1. Where an insurer of an Underlying Policy is or becomes insolvent and cannot pay a loss for which any other participating insurer on the Underlying Policies pays, agrees to pay or is liable to pay as a result of judgment, then the insolvent insurer will be deemed to have paid its limit of liability with respect to said loss.
    2. Where an Insurer is paying a Loss under this Policy, if the Primary Policy or other Underlying Policy imposes a sublimit for any type of Loss, then to the extent that such sublimit has not been totally exhausted and is not specifically excluded under this Policy, then this Policy will provide cover for the unpaid portion of such sublimit.

1. General Conditions
   1. Maintenance of the Underlying Policy(ies)

The Underlying Policy(ies) must be maintained in full effect during the Policy Period, except to the extent the aggregate limits of liability available under the Underlying Policies are eroded or exhausted solely by payment of claims and/ or legal costs and expenses incurred in the defence or settlement of any such loss. If the Underlying Policy(ies) are not maintained in full effect during the Policy Period, the Insurer shall not be liable under this Policy to a greater extent than it would have been had such Underlying Policies been so maintained.

Except as otherwise provided herein, this Policy is subject to the same terms, conditions, exclusions and definitions as the Primary Policy. No amendment to the Primary Policy is effective under this Policy unless the Insurer agrees to the amendment in writing.

- 1. Claims Notification

Any notice required to be given under the conditions of the Primary Policy shall also be given as soon as reasonably practicable by way of written notice (which includes by way of electronic mail) to the party identified in Item 7 of the Schedule.

- 1. Claims Participation

The Insurer shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to participate in the investigation, defence and/or settlement of any claim made against the Insured and notified under the Primary Policy even if the Underlying Policy(ies) has not been exhausted. The Insured will provide such reasonable information and cooperation as is requested.

- 1. Consent

In the event of a claim arising to which the Insurer may be liable to contribute; no costs shall be incurred on behalf of the Insurer without prior written consent of the Insurer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No settlement of a claim that will involve this Policy shall be agreed by the Insured without the prior written consent of the Insurer, such consent not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

- 1. Recoveries and Payments

All recoveries and payments recovered or received subsequent to a settlement under this Policy shall be applied as if recovered or received prior to such settlement and all necessary adjustments shall then me made between the Insured and the Insurers provided always that nothing in this Policy shall be construed to mean that settlements under this Policy are not payable until the Insured’s ultimate net loss has been finally ascertained.

- 1. Sanctions

No Insurer shall be deemed to provide cover and no Insurer shall be liable to pay any claim or provide any benefit hereunder to the extent that the provision of such cover, payment of such claim or provision of such benefit would expose that Insurer to any sanction, prohibition or restriction under United Nations resolutions or the trade or economic sanctions, laws or regulations of the European Union, the United Kingdom or the United States of America.

1. Assignment

No change, modification or assignment of any interest under this Policy shall be effective without the prior written approval of Insurers.

1. Contracts (Right of Third Parties) Act 1999

Any person or company who is not a party to this Policy has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Policy. This condition does not affect any right or remedy which exists or would be available but for the operation of that Act.

1. Law and Jurisdiction

This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and any dispute arising under or in connection with this Policy shall follow the dispute resolution provision in the Primary Policy.

| ENDORSEMENTS:  RECOGNITION OF  EROSION OF  UNDERLYING  SUBLIMIT |  |
| ENDORSEMENT: | In consideration of the payment of premium by the Insured to the Insurer, it is agreed that the following endorsement is attached to this Policy. |


Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, this Policy shall not provide cover in respect of the following coverages as provided for in the Primary Policy:

First Response

Criminal Reward Fund

Civil Aviation Fines & Compensation

Loss Preparation Costs

However, Insurers shall recognise the erosion of the Underlying Policy’s/ies’ aggregate limit(s) as a result of claims paid thereunder in respect of the coverages set out above.

a) Solely in respect of the following coverages as provided for in the Primary Policy:

OSP System Failure

Coverage is sub-limited as follows:

OSP System Failure: GBP 3,750,000

In the event that the Underlying Policy’s/ies’ aggregate limits are eroded through payment by or on behalf of the Insured and/or by the Underlying Insurer(s) with respect to the aforementioned coverages only, the sub-limits applicable to those coverages as set out at

a) above will become available. For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy shall not drop down in respect of any of those coverages.

No settlement of a claim brought under an Underlying Policy against the OSP System Failure as provided for in the Primary Policy shall be effected by the Insured for such a sum as will require payment by Insurers under this Policy unless the consent of the Insurers has first been obtained, such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, withheld or withdrawn.

All other terms, conditions and exclusions remain unaltered.

PREMIUM PAYMENT

TERMS: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary within this contract or any endorsement hereto, in respect of non payment of premium only the following clause will apply.

The (Re)Insured undertakes that premium will be paid in full to (Re)Insurers within 60 days of inception of this contract (or, in respect of instalment premiums, when due).

If the premium due under this contract has not been so paid to (Re)Insurers by the 60th day from the inception date of this contract (and, in respect of instalment premiums, by the date they are due) (Re)Insurers shall have the right to cancel this contract by notifying the (Re)Insured via the broker in writing. In the event of cancellation, premium is due to (Re)Insurers on a pro rata basis for the period that (Re)Insurers are on risk but the full contract premium shall be payable to (Re)Insurers in the event of a loss or occurrence prior to the date of termination which gives rise to a valid claim under this contract.

It is agreed that (Re)Insurers shall give not less than 15 days prior notice of cancellation to the Re(Insured) via the broker. If premium due is paid in full to (Re)Insurers before the notice period expires, notice of cancellation shall automatically be revoked. If not, the contract shall automatically terminate at the end of the notice period.

If any provision of this clause is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the other provisions of this clause which will remain in full force and effect.

In the event that the government of the impacted state either takes an unreasonable length of time to, or does not, or is unable to attribute the cyber operation to another sovereign state or those acting at its direction or under its control, it shall be for the insurer to prove attribution by reference to such other evidence as is available.

Single Claims Agreement Party Arrangements

1. Single Claims Agreement Party

- 1. Scope

All claims having, or circumstances assessed by the SLIP LEADER as having, a Claim Amount at or below GBP 250,000 or currency equivalent (the Threshold Amount) will be designated a Single Claims Agreement Party Claim (SCAP Claim) and will be managed within the terms of these Single Claims Agreement Party Arrangements (these

Arrangements). For the purposes of these Arrangements the SLIP LEADER must be: (a) an authorised person (as defined in Section 31 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) with permission to effect and/or carry out contracts of insurance; or (b) a Member of Lloyd’s.

- 1. Exceptions

Where:

- - 1. the Claim Amount is more than, or, in the assessment of the SLIP LEADER, is likely to be more than, the Threshold Amount; and/or

- - 1. after making further enquiries, there remains insufficient information to form a view on the likely quantum of any circumstance or claim and in the SLIP LEADER’S assessment, there is a material risk that the quantum will ultimately exceed the Threshold Amount; and/or

- - 1. issues arise of fraud or avoidance (either under the Insurance Act 2015 or otherwise) or there are allegations against (re)insurers of regulatory breach which may result in regulatory action being taken against (re)insurers, or actionable allegations of improper claims handling have been made in respect of the claim at issue, or, in the assessment of the SLIP LEADER, such issues are likely to arise in connection with a claim; and/or

- - 1. in the assessment of the SLIP LEADER a claim is, or is likely to become, controversial or complex, or is likely to become subject to Dispute Resolution Proceedings,

such claims or circumstances shall be managed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable BASIS OF CLAIMS AGREEMENT.

1. Slip Leader Responsibilities

- 1. Receipt of a Claim

Upon receiving a notification of a claim or circumstance, the SLIP LEADER shall, as soon as practicable, reasonably assess and decide, based on all the relevant circumstances (including but not limited to the Claims Information), whether such claim or circumstance is a SCAP Claim and notify the Broker accordingly with instructions for it to advise this decision to all claims agreement parties defined in B of the CLAIMS AGREEMENT PARTIES section.

- 1. Role of the Slip Leader

A SCAP Claim shall be Determined by the SLIP LEADER on behalf of itself and all (re)insurers which subscribe: (1) to this Contract on the same contractual terms (other than premium and brokerage); and (2) to these Arrangements (Subscribing (Re)Insurers).

When Determining a SCAP Claim, including where the SLIP LEADER may have delegated the Determination of a SCAP Claim, the SLIP LEADER must always:

2.2.1 act in good faith and exercise the reasonable care of a competent (re)insurer; and

2.2.2 act in the best interest of all Subscribing (Re)Insurers on whose behalf it acts; and

2.2.3 comply with all laws, sanctions regimes, regulations and related guidance

(including, but not limited to, those issued by Lloyd’s, the Financial Conduct

Authority and/or the Prudential Regulation Authority) as may be applicable to the Determination of a SCAP Claim and to which the SLIP LEADER is subject, including, but not limited to conduct of business rules requiring (re)insurers to treat customers fairly (if applicable in that jurisdiction); and

2.2.4 notify either directly or via the Broker, all Subscribing (Re)Insurers of any Dispute Resolution Proceedings commenced against them.

For the avoidance of doubt, the SLIP LEADER shall have no obligations or liability to any (re)insurer, other than a Subscribing (Re)Insurer, arising out of or in any way connected with the Determination of a SCAP Claim.

2.3 Reassigning Claims

Where during the life of a SCAP Claim any of the provisions of clause 1.2 apply, the SLIP LEADER shall:

2.3.1 reassign the SCAP Claim to the claims agreement parties defined in B of the CLAIMS AGREEMENT PARTIES section; and

2.3.2 notify the Broker accordingly with instructions for it to advise all applicable claims agreement parties defined in B of the CLAIMS AGREEMENT PARTIES section, following which the provisions of the applicable BASIS OF CLAIMS AGREEMENT shall apply to the claim.

The SLIP LEADER may, at any time, reassign a SCAP Claim outside of these Arrangements if having due regard to the available Claims Information, all relevant circumstances and its ability to act in accordance with clauses 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 inclusive, it considers that this assignment would be appropriate, following which the provisions of the applicable BASIS OF CLAIMS AGREEMENT shall apply to the claim.

The Broker may also, at any time, reassign a SCAP Claim outside of these Arrangements and to the provisions of the applicable BASIS OF CLAIMS AGREEMENT by advising all claims agreement parties defined in B of the CLAIMS AGREEMENT PARTIES section.

Where a SCAP Claim has been reassigned outside of these Arrangements, it may not, without the consent of all claims agreement parties defined in B of the CLAIMS AGREEMENT PARTIES section, be reassigned as a SCAP Claim.

Notwithstanding clauses 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 but without prejudice to any other right or requirement to (re)assign a SCAP Claim outside of these Arrangements, where the exchange rate between Sterling and the currency in which the SCAP Claim has been made fluctuates after the conversion date stated in A of the CLAIMS AGREEMENT PARTIES section such that the Sterling value of the claim exceeds the Threshold Amount, the claim shall not cease to be a SCAP Claim by reason of the currency fluctuation alone.

2.5 Processing Claims

The SLIP LEADER shall ensure that all supporting information has been properly documented prior to payment of the claim and that such records are kept for a period of no less than seven years after closure, subject always to the requirements of applicable laws (including but not limited to those applicable to the processing of personal data and privacy).

1. Broker Responsibilities

Notwithstanding the application of these Arrangements, the Broker shall advise all claims agreement parties defined in B of the CLAIMS AGREEMENT PARTIES section of any or all of the following matters or events, where known, as soon as practicable:

- 1. any new claim or circumstance assigned as a SCAP Claim;

A Subscribing (Re)Insurer may request the SLIP LEADER and/or Broker to provide such further information as it may reasonably require and the SLIP LEADER and Broker shall cooperate fully with any such request.

1. Termination of the SLIP LEADER’s Authority

In the event that the SLIP LEADER:

- 1. becomes the subject of voluntary or involuntary rehabilitation or liquidation, action in bankruptcy or similar or in any way otherwise acknowledges its insolvency or is unable to pay its debts or losses; or
  2. has its right to transact the main class of business covered by the slip withdrawn, suspended, removed or made conditional or impaired in any way by any regulatory authority; or
  3. ceases to be either: (a) an authorised person (as defined in Section 31 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) with permission to effect and/or carry out contracts of insurance; or (b) a member of Lloyd’s,

the authority of that SLIP LEADER to Determine all SCAP Claims shall automatically terminate from the date of that event, following which the provisions of the applicable BASIS OF CLAIMS AGREEMENT shall apply to the claim.

1. Professional Advisers

- 1. The SLIP LEADER has the sole authority to appoint and instruct an independent, external, professional adviser (which may include, but is not limited to, a lawyer, loss adjuster, surveyor, actuary or accountant) on behalf of Subscribing (Re)Insurers where, in its sole discretion, it considers the professional adviser necessary for the Determination of a claim. The SLIP LEADER shall supervise the professional adviser throughout the period of their appointment.

- 1. A professional adviser appointed in connection with a SCAP Claim pursuant to clause 5.1 above may, at the SLIP LEADER’s discretion, be instructed to send all reports and correspondence directly to the SLIP LEADER. The professional adviser’s fees shall be agreed by the SLIP LEADER. The fees of the professional adviser shall be shared between the Subscribing (Re)Insurers in accordance with

their respective shares of the SCAP Claim.

1. Claims Concerns

If a Subscribing (Re)Insurer has a concern regarding the handling of a SCAP Claim by the

SLIP LEADER it shall notify the SLIP LEADER of its concern. The SLIP LEADER and the Subscribing (Re)Insurer which has raised the concern shall promptly confer and use their best endeavours to resolve the concern. If any disagreement remains after a period of 28 days from the date on which the concern was notified to the SLIP LEADER, the authority of the SLIP LEADER to Determine the SCAP Claim to which the concern relates shall terminate, following which the provisions of the applicable BASIS OF CLAIMS AGREEMENT shall apply to the claim.

1. Intra-(Re)Insurer Dispute Resolution Protocols

Before a Subscribing (Re)Insurer (Claimant) can bring a legal claim against the SLIP LEADER in relation to the Determination of a SCAP Claim or for an alleged breach of its obligations under these Arrangements, it must first attempt to resolve the dispute (Dispute) as follows:

- 1. The Claimant shall notify the SLIP LEADER that it is commencing the Dispute Resolution Protocols prescribed in this clause 7.
  2. The Dispute shall first be referred to representatives of the SLIP LEADER and of the Claimant who shall meet in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute. If a resolution is not achieved within 21 days from the date the Dispute was referred to these individuals, the matter shall be escalated to a member of senior management responsible for claims, for each of the Claimant and SLIP LEADER, who shall attempt to resolve the Dispute.
  3. If the Dispute has not been resolved within 28 days from the date upon which it is referred to senior management, then the Claimant and SLIP LEADER shall enter into a mediation agreement in the form prescribed by the LMA and IUA. If the resulting mediation fails to resolve the Dispute, then the Dispute shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with clause 7.4, provided always that the decision to commence an arbitration must be taken by the senior management of the Claimant in question.
  4. All arbitrations arising out of or in connection with a Dispute shall be referred to arbitration under ARIAS Fast Track Arbitration Rules. The seat of arbitration shall be London.

1. Limitation of Liability

- 1. The total liability, whether in contract, in tort (including but not limited to negligence), breach of fiduciary duty, breach of statutory duty or otherwise, of a SLIP LEADER to all Subscribing (Re)Insurers on whose behalf it has acted, or is acting, under these Arrangements shall not exceed GBP 500,000 in respect of any one SCAP Claim (Liability Cap).

- 1. If the aggregate liability of a SLIP LEADER in respect of any one SCAP Claim would exceed the Liability Cap, the Subscribing (Re)Insurers shall each be entitled to be paid only a share of the Liability Cap calculated in proportion to the share of the (re)insurance underwritten by each Subscribing (Re)Insurer (excluding for the purposes of this clause any share underwritten by the SLIP LEADER).
  2. A SLIP LEADER shall not be liable for loss of profits, loss of business, loss of use (in each case whether direct or indirect) or any other indirect, special, or consequential damages alleged to have been suffered by a Subscribing (Re)Insurer arising out of its breach of the terms of these Arrangements.
  3. Notwithstanding clause 8.3 but subject always to clauses 8.1, 8.2 and 8.5, nothing in this clause 8 is intended to exclude the SLIP LEADER’S liability to the Subscribing (Re)Insurers in respect of damages payable by the Subscribing (Re)Insurers to the (re)insured, in addition to the Claim Amount, arising from the mishandling of a SCAP Claim by the SLIP LEADER, its agents or employees, where such mishandling gives rise to an actionable claim for damages against Subscribing (Re)Insurers.
  4. Nothing in these Arrangements shall exclude, restrict or limit with respect to the handling of a SCAP Claim a SLIP LEADER’s liability for: (1) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (2) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or the negligence of its employees or agents; or (3) any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful to exclude or restrict liability.

1. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction

Notwithstanding any other choice of law, express or implied in the contract of (re)insurance, the provisions of these Arrangements shall be construed and governed in accordance with the Laws of England and Wales and the Subscribing (Re)Insurers submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales.

(RE)INSURER’S

LIABILITY: (RE)INSURERS LIABILITY CLAUSE

(Re)insurer’s liability several and not joint

The liability of an (Re)Insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other (Re)Insurers party to this contract. An (Re)Insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten. A (Re)Insurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other (Re)Insurer. Nor is a (Re)Insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (Re)Insurer that may underwrite this contract.

The proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (Re)Insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning “signing” below.

In the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a (Re)Insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member’s proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member’s proportion. Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other Insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each member is Lloyd’s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd’s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd’s, at the above address.

Proportion of liability

Unless there is “signing” (see below), the proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its “written line”

Where this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted (“signed”). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd’s syndicate taken together) is referred to as a “signed line”. The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.

Although reference is made at various points in this clause to “this contract” in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to contracts in the plural.

21/06/07 LMA3333

In respect of Companies (Including Lloyd's Insurance Company S.A.)

Several Liability Notice

The subscribing insurers' obligations under contracts of (re)insurance to which they subscribe are several and not joint and are limited solely to the extent of their individual subscriptions. The subscribing (re)insurers are not responsible for the subscription of any co-subscribing (re)insurer who for any reason does not satisfy all or part of its obligations.

| ORDER HEREON:  BASIS OF WRITTEN | 100% of 100% |
| LINES:  BASIS OF SIGNED | Percentage of Whole. |
| LINES:  SIGNING | Percentage of Whole. |
| PROVISIONS:  MODE OF  EXECUTION | In the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, any lines written “to stand” will be allocated in full and all other lines will be signed down in equal proportions so that the aggregate signed lines are equal to 100% of the order without further agreement of any of the (re)insurers. However:   1. in the event that the placement of the order is not completed by the commencement date of the period of (re)insurance then all lines written by that date will be signed in full; 2. the signed lines resulting from the application of the above provisions can be varied, before or after the commencement date of the period of (re)insurance, by the documented agreement of the (re)insured and all (re)insurers whose lines are to be varied. The variation to the contracts will take effect only when all such insurers have agreed, with the resulting variation in signed lines commencing from the date set out in that agreement. |
| CLAUSE: | This contract and any changes to it may be executed by: |


1. electronic signature technology employing computer software and a digital signature or digitiser pen pad to capture a person’s handwritten signature in such a manner that the signature is unique to the person signing, is under the sole control of the person signing, is capable of verification to authenticate the signature and is linked to the document signed in such a manner that if the data is changed, such signature is invalidated;
2. a unique authorisation provided via a secure electronic trading platform
3. a timed and dated authorisation provided via an electronic message/system;
4. an exchange of facsimile/scanned copies showing the original written ink signature of paper documents;
5. an original written ink signature of paper documents (or a true representation of a signature, such as a rubber stamp).;

The use of any one or a combination of these methods of execution shall constitute a legally binding and valid signing of this contract. This contract may be executed in one or more of the above counterparts, each of which, when duly executed, shall be deemed an original

WRITTEN LINES: In a co-insurance placement following (re)insurers may, but are not obliged to, follow the premium charged by the lead (re)insurer.

(Re)insurers may not seek to guarantee for themselves terms as favourable as those which others subsequently achieve during the placement.
