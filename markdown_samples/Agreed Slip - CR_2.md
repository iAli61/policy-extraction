# SECURITY DETAILS

**(RE)INSURER’S**

**LIABILITY:** **LMA 3333 – (RE)INSURER’S LIABILITY CLAUSE**

**(Re)insurer’s liability several not joint**

The liability of a (re)insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other (re)insurers party to this contract. A (re)insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten by any other (re)insurer. Nor is a (re)insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract.

The proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning “signing” below.

In the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a (re)insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportion underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other member’s proportion. Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each member is Lloyd’s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd’s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to market services,

Lloyd’s at the above address.

**Proportion of liability**

Unless there is “signing” (see below), the proportion of liability under this

contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its written line”.

Where this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted (“signed”). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd’s syndicate taken together) is referred to as a “signed line”. The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.

Although reference is made at various points in this clause to “this contract” in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as reference to contracts in the plural.

| **SIGNING** |  | Lines Clause NMA2419, if applicable. |
| **PROVISIONS:** |  | Proportionate signing: |
|  |  | In the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, any |
|  |  | lines written “to stand” will be allocated in full and all other lines will be signed |
|  |  | down in equal proportions so that the aggregate signed lines are equal to |
|  |  | 100% of the order without further agreement of any of the (re)insurers: |
|  |  | However:   1. In the event that the placement of the order is not completed by the commencement date of the period of (re)insurance then all lines written by that date will be signed in full; 2. the disproportionate signing of (re)insurer’s lines can be effected without further specific agreement of (re)insurers, provided that any such variation is made prior to the commencement date of the period of (re)insurance, and that lines written “to stand” may not be varied without the documented agreement of those (re)insurers; 3. The signed lines resulting from the application of the above provisions can be varied, before or after the commencement date of the period of (re)insurance, by the documented agreement of the (re)insured and all (re)insurers whose lines are to be varied. The variation to the contracts will take effect only when all such (re)insurers have agreed, with the resulting variation in signed lines commencing from the date set out in that agreement. |
| **LINE CONDITIONS:** |  | None unless (re)insurers indicate otherwise hereon |
| **MODE OF EXECUTION:** | | This contract and any changes to it may be executed by:   1. electronic signature technology employing computer software and a digital signature or digitiser pen pad to capture a person’s handwritten signature in such a manner that the signature is unique to the person signing, is under the sole control of the person signing, is capable of verification to authenticate the signature and is linked to the document signed in such a manner that if the data is changed, such signature is invalidated; 2. a unique authorisation provided via a secure electronic trading platform; 3. a timed and dated authorisation provided via an electronic message/system; 4. an exchange of facsimile/scanned copies showing the original written ink signature of paper documents; 5. an original written ink signature of paper documents (or a true representation of a signature, such as a rubber stamp). |
|  | | The use of any one or a combination of these methods of execution shall |
|  | | constitute a legally binding and valid signing of this contract. This contract |
|  | | may be executed in one or more of the above counterparts, each of which, |
|  | | when duly executed, shall be deemed an original. |
