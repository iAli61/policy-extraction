The right to purchase the **Optional Extension Period** shall terminate (i) in the event written notice together with full payment of the premium for the **Optional Extension Period** is not given to Underwriters within thirty (30) days after the Policy expiration date or (ii) in the event the **Predetermined Run-Off Period** is purchased.

The right to purchase the **Predetermined Run-Off Period** shall terminate (i) in the event written notice together with full payment of the premium for the **Predetermined Run-Off Period** is not given to Underwriters within thirty (30) days after the date of the **Corporate Takeover** or (ii) in the event the **Optional Extension Period** is purchased.

If such notice and premium payment is not so given to Underwriters, there shall be no right to purchase the **Optional Extension Period** or the **Predetermined Run-Off Period**.

In the event of the purchase of the **Optional Extension Period** or the **Predetermined RunOff Period**, the entire premium therefor shall be deemed earned at its commencement.

The exercise of the **Optional Extension Period**, the **Predetermined Run-Off Period** or the Retired and Resigned Insured Person Extension shall not in any way increase the Limit of Liability of Underwriters.

1. **ASSISTANCE, COOPERATION AND SUBROGATION**

The **Insureds** agree to provide Underwriters with such information, assistance and cooperation as Underwriters or their counsel may reasonably request, and they further agree that, after a **Claim** has been made against them, an **Investigation** has been commenced against them or an **Inquiry** has been received by them, they shall not take any action which in any way increases Underwriters' exposure under this Policy. The failure of any of the **Insured Persons** to give Underwriters or their counsel the information, assistance and cooperation that they may reasonably request shall not impair the rights of any other natural person under this Policy.

In the event of any payment under this Policy, Underwriters shall be subrogated to the **Insureds'** rights of recovery therefor against any person or entity. The **Insureds** shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure and preserve such rights including the execution of such documents as are necessary to enable Underwriters effectively to bring suit in their name, and shall provide all other assistance and cooperation which Underwriters may reasonably require.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Underwriters agree to waive their rights of subrogation against any of the **Insured Persons** except where a final non-appealable adjudication in any action or proceeding (other than an action or proceeding initiated by Underwriters to determine coverage under this Policy) adverse to the relevant **Insured Persons** establishes that the relevant **Insured Persons** have committed a deliberately fraudulent or deliberately criminal act or omission.

1. **ASSIGNMENTS AND ACTION AGAINST UNDERWRITERS**

No action shall lie against Underwriters unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the **Insureds** shall have fully complied with all of the terms of this Policy, nor until the amount of the **Insureds'** obligation to pay shall have been fully and finally determined either by judgment against them or by written agreement between them, the claimant and Underwriters. Nothing contained herein shall give any person or organization any right to join Underwriters as a party to any **Claim**, **Investigation** or **Inquiry** against the **Insureds** to determine their liability, nor shall Underwriters be impleaded by the **Insureds** or their legal representative in any **Claim**, **Investigation** or **Inquiry**. Assignment of interest under this Policy shall not bind Underwriters unless their consent is endorsed hereon.

1. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT**

By acceptance of this Policy, the **Insureds** agree that this Policy embodies all agreements existing between them and Underwriters or any of their agents relating to this Insurance. Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent or other person acting on behalf of Underwriters shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part of this Policy or estop Underwriters from asserting any right under the terms of this Policy, nor shall the terms be waived or changed except by written endorsement or rider issued by Underwriters to form a part of this Policy.

1. **ALLOCATION**

If both **Loss** covered by this Policy and loss uncovered by this Policy are incurred, either because the **Claim**, **Investigation** or **Inquiry** includes both covered and uncovered allegations or because it includes both insured and uninsured parties, then the **Insureds** and Underwriters agree to use their best efforts to fairly and reasonably allocate such amount between covered **Loss** and uncovered loss.

In the event that a method of allocation cannot be agreed upon by Underwriters and the **Insureds**, then:

- - - - 1. in any arbitration, suit or other proceeding, no presumption shall exist concerning what is a fair and reasonable allocation;

- - - - 1. Underwriters shall advance the amount of **Costs, Charges and Expenses** or **Inquiry Costs** which they deem fair and proper until a different amount is negotiated by the parties, determined pursuant to the arbitration process set forth in subparagraph C. below, or determined judicially;

- - - - 1. Underwriters, solely if requested by the **Insureds**, shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The rules of the American Arbitration Association shall apply except with respect to the selection of the arbitration panel, which shall consist of one arbitrator selected by the **Insureds**, one arbitrator selected by Underwriters, and a third independent arbitrator selected by the first two arbitrators.

Any negotiated, arbitrated or judicially determined allocation of **Costs, Charges and Expenses** or **Inquiry Costs** on account of a **Claim**, **Investigation** or **Inquiry** shall be applied retroactively to all **Costs, Charges and Expenses** or **Inquiry Costs** on account of such **Claim**, **Investigation** or **Inquiry**, notwithstanding any prior advancement to the contrary. Any allocation or advancement of **Costs, Charges and Expenses** or **Inquiry Costs** on account of a **Claim**, **Investigation** or **Inquiry** shall not apply to or create any presumption with respect to the allocation of other **Loss** on account of such **Claim**, **Investigation** or **Inquiry**.

1. **WORLDWIDE**

This Policy applies only to **Claims** first made **Investigations** first commenced and **Inquiries** first reported during the **Policy Period** anywhere in the world as permitted by law.

1. **SERVICE OF SUIT**

It is agreed that in the event of the failure of Underwriters to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, Underwriters at the request of any of the **Insureds** will submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction within the United States and will comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction. Nothing in this Clause constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of Underwriters' rights to commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States. It is further agreed that service of process in such suit may be made upon the firm shown under Item M. of the Declarations, and that in such suit instituted against any one of the Underwriters upon this Policy, Underwriters will abide by the final decision of such court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal.

The firm shown under Item M. of the Declarations is authorized and directed to accept service of process on behalf of Underwriters in any such suit and/or upon the request of any of the **Insureds** to give a written undertaking to such **Insured** that it will enter a general appearance upon Underwriters' behalf in the event such a suit shall be instituted.

Further, pursuant to the statute of any state, territory or district of the United States which makes provision therefor, Underwriters hereon hereby designate the Superintendent, Commissioner or Director of Insurance or other officers specified for that purpose in the statute, or any of their successors in office, as their true and lawful attorney, upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of any of the **Insureds** or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Policy, and hereby designate the firm shown in Item M. of the Declaration as the firm to whom the said officer is authorized to mail such process or a true copy thereof.

1. **CHOICE OF LAW**

Except with respect to the insurability of damages under Clause II.O., any dispute involving this Policy shall be resolved by applying the law of the state designated in Item N. of the Declarations.

In such event, Underwriters shall be entitled to obtain reimbursement from the **Company** for all payments made by Underwriters that would not have been made had the indemnity in respect of the Retention been provided by the **Company**, unless the **Company** is unable to indemnify by reason of its insolvency.

Notwithstanding the above, if and to the extent any covered **Loss** which is within any applicable Retention under this Policy is paid on behalf of the **Insured Persons** by any other insurer pursuant to the terms and conditions of any Excess Difference in Conditions Side A policy which is specifically excess of this Policy, then such applicable Retention under this Policy shall be eroded by the amount of such payment.

## POLICYHOLDER DISCLOSURE NOTICE OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE

Coverage for acts of terrorism is already included in the policy (including any quotation for insurance) to which this notice applies. You should know that, under the policy, any losses caused by certified acts of terrorism would be partially reimbursed by the United States under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula, the United States pays 85% through 2015; 84% beginning on January 1, 2016; 83% beginning on January 1, 2017; 82% beginning on January 1, 2018; 81% beginning on January 1, 2019 and 80% beginning on January 1, 2020; of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurer providing the coverage. However, your policy may contain other exclusions which might affect your coverage, such as exclusion for nuclear events. The term "act of terrorism" means any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or vessel or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals, as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended, contains a USD 100 billion cap that limits U.S. Government reimbursement as well as insurers liability for losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism when the amount of such losses exceeds USD 100 billion in any one calendar year. If the aggregate insured losses for all insurers exceed USD 100 billion, your coverage may be reduced.

The portion of your annual premium that is attributable to coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended, is 1.00% of the (100%) annual premium detailed in Risk Details.

YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT UNDER THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002, AS AMENDED, ANY LOSSES CAUSED BY CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM UNDER YOUR POLICY COVERAGE WILL BE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY THE UNITED STATES, SUBJECT TO A USD 100 BILLION CAP THAT MAY REDUCE YOUR COVERAGE, AND YOU HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH COVERAGE.

**Option to Reject Terrorism Insurance Coverage**

Your policy automatically provides coverage for claims arising out of acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 at no additional cost to you.

If you would prefer not to have such coverage please check the box below, sign where indicated and return this form to your insurance broker or intermediary.

**Please note that there will be no reduction in premium if terrorism coverage is removed from your policy.**

If premium due is paid in full to Underwriters before the notice period expires, notice of cancellation shall automatically be revoked. If not, the policy shall automatically terminate at the end of the notice period.

Unless otherwise agreed, the Leading Underwriter (and Agreement Parties if appropriate) are authorised to exercise rights under this clause on their own behalf and on behalf of all Underwriters participating in this contract.

If any provision of this clause is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the other provisions of this clause which will remain in full force and effect.

Where the premium is to be paid through a London Market Bureau, payment to Underwriters will be deemed to occur on the day of delivery of a premium advice note to the Bureau.

# SECURITY DETAILS

## SECURITY DETAILS

In a co-insurance placement, following insurers may, but are not obliged to, follow the premium charged by the slip leader.

Insurers may not seek to guarantee for themselves terms as favourable as those which others subsequently achieve during the placement.

**INSURER’S LIABILITY:**

**(Re)insurer’s liability several not joint**

The liability of a (re)insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other (re)insurers party to this contract. A (re)insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten. A (re)insurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other (re)insurer. Nor is a (re)insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract.

The proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning “signing” below.

In the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a (re)insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total line itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member’s proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member’s proportion. Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each member is Lloyd’s, One Lime Street, London, EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd’s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd’s, at the above address.

**Proportion of liability**

Unless there is “signing” (see below), the proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in each case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its “written line”.

Where this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted (“signed”). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd’s syndicate taken together) is referred to as a “signed line”. The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.

Although reference is made at various points in this clause to “this contract” in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to contracts in the plural.

| **ORDER HEREON:** | As per the total signed lines as detailed in Security Details. |
| **BASIS OF WRITTEN LINES:** | Percentage of Whole |
| **BASIS OF SIGNED LINES:** | Percentage of Whole |
| **SIGNING PROVISIONS:** | In the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, any lines written “to stand” will be allocated in full and all other lines will be signed down in equal proportions so that the aggregate signed lines are equal to 100% of the order without further agreement of any of the (re)insurers. |
|  | However:   1. in the event that the placement of the order is not complete by the commencement date of the period of insurance then all lines written by that date will be signed in full;      1. the signed lines resulting from the application of the above provisions can be varied, before or after the commencement date of the period of insurance, by the documented agreement of the (re)insured and all (re)insurers whose lines are to be varied. The variation to the contracts will take effect only when all such (re)insurers have agreed, with the resulting variation in signed lines commencing from the date set out in that agreement. |
| **MODE OF EXECUTION:** | This contract and any changes to it may be executed by:   1. electronic signature technology employing computer software and a digital signature or digitiser pen pad to capture a person’s handwritten signature in such a manner that the signature is unique to the person signing, is under the sole control of the person signing, is capable of verification to authenticate the signature and is linked to the document signed in such a manner that if the data is changed, such signature is invalidated;      1. a unique authorisation provided via a secure electronic trading platform      1. a timed and dated authorisation provided via an electronic message/system;      1. an exchange of facsimile/scanned copies showing the original written ink signature of paper documents;      1. an original written ink signature of paper documents (or a true representation of a signature, such as a rubber stamp).; |


The use of any one or a combination of these methods of execution shall constitute a legally binding and valid signing of this contract. This contract may be executed in one or more of the above counterparts, each of which, when duly executed, shall be deemed an original.
