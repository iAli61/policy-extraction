The right to purchase the predetermined run-off period shall terminate (i) in the event written notice together with full payment of the premium for the predetermined run-off period is not given to underwriters within thirty (30) days after the date of the corporate takeover or (ii) in the event the optional extension period is purchased.

If such notice and premium payment is not so given to underwriters, there shall be no right to purchase the optional extension period or the predetermined run-off period.

- - 1. In the event of the purchase of the optional extension period or the predetermined run-off period, the entire premium therefor shall be deemed earned at its commencement.

- - 1. The exercise of the optional extension period, the predetermined run-off period or the retired and resigned insured person extension shall not in any way increase the limit of liability of underwriters.

1. Assistance, co-operation and subrogation

The insureds agree to provide underwriters with such information, assistance and cooperation as underwriters or their counsel may reasonably request, and they further agree that, after a claim has been made against them, an investigation has been commenced against them or an inquiry has been received by them, they shall not take any action which in any way increases

underwriters' exposure under this policy. In respect of insuring clause i.a., the failure of any of the insureds to give underwriters or their counsel the information, assistance and cooperation that they may reasonably request shall not impair the rights of any other natural person under this policy. In respect of insuring clause i.b., the failure of any of the insured persons to give the underwriters or their counsel the information, assistance and cooperation that they may reasonably request shall not impair the rights of the company under this policy with respect to any indemnification provided to any other insured person.

In the event of any payment under this policy, underwriters shall be subrogated to the insureds' rights of recovery therefor against any person or entity. The insureds shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure and preserve such rights including the execution of such documents as are necessary to enable underwriters effectively to bring suit in their name, and shall provide all other assistance and co-operation which underwriters may reasonably require.]

Notwithstanding the foregoing, underwriters agree to waive their rights of recoupment or subrogation against any of the insured persons except where a final non-appealable adjudication in any underlying action adverse to the relevant insured persons, which action shall not include any action or proceeding brought by or against underwriters, establishes that the relevant insured persons have committed a deliberately fraudulent or deliberately criminal act or omission.

The reporting of matters to, and subsequent communication with a regulatory authority by the company or any of the insured persons, whether pursuant to law, regulation or otherwise will not constitute a contravention of this provision by the company or such insured persons.

1. Assignments and action against underwriters

No action shall lie against underwriters unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insureds shall have fully complied with all of the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the insureds' obligation to pay shall have been fully and finally determined either by judgment against them or by written agreement between them, the claimant and underwriters. Nothing contained herein shall give any person or organization any right to join underwriters as a party to any claim, investigation or inquiry against the insureds to determine their liability, nor shall underwriters be impleaded by the insureds or their legal representative in any claim, investigation or inquiry. Assignment of interest under this policy shall not bind underwriters unless their consent is endorsed hereon.

1. Entire agreement

By acceptance of this policy, the insureds agree that this policy embodies all agreements existing between them and underwriters or any of their agents relating to this insurance. Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent or other person acting on behalf of underwriters shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part of this policy or estop underwriters from asserting any right under the terms of this policy, nor shall the terms be waived or changed except by written endorsement or rider issued by underwriters to form a part of this policy.

1. Allocation

If both loss covered by this policy and loss uncovered by this policy are incurred, either because the claim, investigation or inquiry includes both covered and uncovered allegations or because it includes both insured and uninsured parties, then the insureds and underwriters agree to use their best efforts to fairly and reasonably allocate such amount between covered loss and uncovered loss.

In the event that a method of allocation cannot be agreed upon by underwriters and the insureds, then:

- 1. in any arbitration, suit or other proceeding, no presumption shall exist concerning what is a fair and reasonable allocation;

- 1. underwriters shall advance the amount of costs, charges and expenses or inquiry costs which they deem fair and proper until a different amount is negotiated by the parties, determined pursuant to the arbitration process set forth in subparagraph c. below, or determined judicially;

- 1. underwriters, solely if requested by the insureds, shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The rules of the American Arbitration Association shall apply except with respect to the selection of the arbitration panel, which shall consist of one arbitrator selected by the insureds, one arbitrator selected by underwriters, and a third independent arbitrator selected by the first two arbitrators.

Any negotiated, arbitrated or judicially determined allocation of costs, charges and expenses or inquiry costs on account of a claim, investigation or inquiry shall be applied retroactively to all costs, charges and expenses or inquiry costs on account of such claim, investigation or inquiry, notwithstanding any prior advancement to the contrary. Any allocation or advancement of costs, charges and expenses or inquiry costs on account of a claim, investigation or inquiry shall not

apply to or create any presumption with respect to the allocation of other loss on account of such claim, investigation or inquiry.

1. Worldwide

This policy applies only to claims first made, investigations first commenced and inquiries first reported and books and records demands first made during the policy period anywhere in the world as permitted by law.

1. Service of suit

It is agreed that in the event of the failure of underwriters to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, underwriters at the request of any of the insureds will submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction within the United States and will comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction. Nothing in this clause constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of underwriters' rights to commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States. It is further agreed that service of process in such suit may be made upon the firm shown under item m. of the declarations, and that in such suit instituted

against any one of the underwriters upon this policy, underwriters will abide by the final decision of such court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal.

The firm shown under item m. of the declarations is authorized and directed to accept service of process on behalf of underwriters in any such suit and/or upon the request of any of the insureds to give a written undertaking to such insured that it will enter a general appearance upon underwriters' behalf in the event such a suit shall be instituted.

Further, pursuant to the statute of any state, territory or district of the United States which makes provision therefor, underwriters hereon hereby designate the

Superintendent, Commissioner or Director of Insurance or other officers specified for that purpose in the statute, or any of their successors in office, as their true and lawful attorney, upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of any of the insureds or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this policy, and hereby designate the firm shown in item m. of the declarations as the firm to whom the said officer is authorized to mail such process or a true copy thereof.

xvi. Choice of law

Except with respect to the insurability of damages under clause ii.s., any dispute involving this policy shall be resolved by applying the law of the state designated in item n. of the declarations.

POLICYHOLDER DISCLOSURE

NOTICE OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE

Coverage for acts of terrorism is already included in the policy (including any quotation for insurance) to which this notice applies. You should know that, under the policy, any losses caused by certified acts of terrorism would be partially reimbursed by the United States under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula, the United States pays 80% of covered terrorism losses exceeding

the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurer providing the coverage. However, your policy may contain other exclusions which might affect your coverage, such as exclusion for nuclear

events. The term “act of terrorism” means any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or vessel or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals, as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended, contains a USD100 billion cap that limits U.S. Government reimbursement as well as insurers' liability for losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism when the amount of such losses exceeds USD100 billion in any one calendar year. If the aggregate insured losses for all insurers exceed USD100 billion, your coverage may be reduced.

The portion of your annual premium that is attributable to coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended, is: 1%

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT UNDER THE TERRORISM RISK

INSURANCE ACT OF 2002, AS AMENDED, ANY LOSSES CAUSED BY CERTIFIED ACTS

OF TERRORISM UNDER USD100 BILLION CAP THAT MAY REDUCE MY COVERAGE, AND I HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE AMOUNT OF MY PREMIUM ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH COVERAGE.

This Service of Suit Clause will not be read to conflict with or override the obligations of the parties to arbitrate their disputes as provided for in any Arbitration provision within this Policy.

Nothing in this Clause constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of Underwriters' rights to commence an action in any Court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United

States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another Court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any State in the United States.

It is further agreed that service of process in such suit may be made upon Lloyd’s America,

| (RE)INSURER’S LIABILITY: | LMA3333 |


(Re)insurer’s liability several not joint

The liability of a (re)insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other (re)insurers party to this contract. A (re)insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten. A (re)insurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other (re)insurer. Nor is a (re)insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract.

The proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning ‘signing’ below.

In the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a (re)insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member’s proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member’s proportion. Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each member is Lloyd’s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd’s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd’s, at the above address.

Proportion of liability

Unless there is ‘signing’ (see below), the proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its ‘written line’.

Where this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted (‘signed’). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate,

the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together).

A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd’s syndicate taken together) is referred to as a ‘signed line’. The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.

Although reference is made at various points in this clause to ‘this contract’ in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to contracts in the plural.

Where coverage includes both EEA and Non EEA exposure, the following is applicable to Lloyds Insurance Company(ies) participation only which replaces the LMA3333 above.

SEVERAL LIABILITY NOTICE

The subscribing (re)insurers' obligations under contracts of (re)insurance to which they subscribe are several and not joint and are limited solely to the extent of their individual subscriptions. The subscribing (re)insurers are not responsible for the subscription of any co-subscribing (re)insurer who for any reason does not satisfy all or part of its obligations.

| ORDER HEREON: | 100% of 100% |
|  |  |
|  |  |
| BASIS OF WRITTEN LINES: | Percentage of Whole |
|  |  |
|  |  |
| SIGNING  PROVISIONS: | In the event that the written lines hereon exceed 100% of the order, any lines written ‘to stand’ will be allocated in full and all other lines will be signed down in equal proportions so that the aggregate signed lines are equal to 100% of the order without further agreement of any of the underwriters. |


However:

1. in the event that the placement of the order is not completed by the commencement date of the period of Insurance then all lines written by that date will be signed in full;

1. the (Re)Insured may elect for the disproportionate signing of

(Re)Insurers’ lines, without further specific agreement of (Re)Insurers, providing that any such variation is made prior to the commencement date of the period of (Re)insurance, and that lines written ‘To Stand’ may not be varied without the documented agreement of those (Re)Insurers;

the signed lines resulting from the application of the above provisions can be varied, before or after the commencement date of the period of Insurance, by the documented agreement of the (Re)Insured and all underwriters whose lines are to be varied. The variation to the contracts will take effect only when all such underwriters have agreed, with the resulting variation in signed lines commencing from the date set out in that agreement.

In relation to the WRITTEN LINES:

MODE OF EXECUTION:

This contract and any changes to it may be executed by:

- electronic signature technology employing computer software and a digital signature or digitiser pen pad to capture a person’s handwritten signature in such a manner that the signature is unique to the person signing, is under the sole control of the person signing, is capable of verification to authenticate the signature and is linked to the document signed in such a manner that if the data is changed, such signature is invalidated;

- a unique authorisation provided via a secure electronic trading platform;

- a timed and dated authorisation provided via an electronic message/system;

- an exchange of facsimile/scanned copies showing the original written ink signature of paper documents;

- an original written ink signature of paper documents (or a true representation of a signature, such as a rubber stamp).

The use of any one or a combination of these methods of execution shall constitute a legally binding and valid signing of this contract. This contract may be executed in one or more of the above counterparts, each of which, when duly executed, shall be deemed an original.

In a co-(re)insurance placement, following (re)insurers may, but are not obliged to, follow the premium charged by the contract leader.

(Re)Insurers may not seek to guarantee for themselves terms as favourable as those which others subsequently achieve during the placement.

(Re)Insurers confirm and agree that where NCAD (Notice of Cancellation at Anniversary

Date) is embedded in their stamp/line this will mean NCED (Notice of Cancellation at Expiry Date). This does not affect the right of the (re)insurer to issue a Notice of Cancellation in accordance with the contract terms.

Bureau re(insurers) agree to allow XIS not to ‘group’ associated de-linked signings. Each individual de-linked signing may be released for settlement to XIS independently of any other associated items.

Presentation to XIS of a contract with a premium payment warranty (PPW), premium payment condition (PPC) or prompt payment condition for a signing number and date within the timeframe specified within the warranty or condition shall be sufficient evidence of compliance and payment to all (re)insurers participating hereon. Subsequent rejection shall not affect the fact that the warranty/condition and/or the settlement due date (SDD) has been met by the original presentation and therefore no further update of the due date is required.

In respect of the LSW3001 (amended) or any other Premium Payment Clause, the SDD will automatically be amended to the date the premium is paid to (re)insurers.

Where any SDD, PPW or PPC due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, presentation to XIS on the next working day will be deemed to be in compliance with such SDD, PPW or PPC.

(Re)Insurers agree that the second and subsequent premium instalments are taken down as additional premiums, other than annual re-signings.

In respect of additional premium signings the SDD will follow the same payment period allowed under the original premium payment terms. However, the payment period shall commence from the date of the final agreement of the endorsement or the effective date, whichever is the later.

Claims and/or return premiums may be collected and taken down on production of a copy (including a photocopy) and/or duplicate of the applicable contract or policy.

In respect of non–settlement currencies:

XIS to accept settlement of premium in Pounds Sterling (GBP) converted at the rate of exchange at the date of receipt of payment by Solstice Agencies. However, in the event Solstice Agencies are paid in Pounds Sterling (GBP), U.S. Dollars (USD) or EUROS (EUR) then settlement will be made via XIS in GBP, USD or EUR as received by Solstice Agencies.

Bureau (re)insurers agree to accept an interim For Declaration Only (FDO) signing.

|  | In respect of electronically placed lines via PPL. In the event the Settlement Due Date and/or the Allocation of Premium to Coding and/or Year of Account shown in the PPL Security Details differ from those shown in this MRC, the information set forth in PPL shall take precedence. |
|  |  |
|  |  |
| PLACING  PLATFORM  LIMITED (PPL)  ARRANGEMENTS: | (Re)insurers instruct Xchanging to accept any attachments and additional information as detailed in this Market Reform Contract and any subsequent endorsements thereto, without sight of agreement from (re)insurers on the understanding that Solstice Agencies has obtained agreement thereto from the applicable (re)insurers.    In no circumstances will Insurers be held to have accepted any document until agreed to via the PPL platform, whether or not accepted by Xchanging. |
|  |  |
|  |  |
| NON–BUREAUX ARRANGEMENTS: | Where any Premium Payment Warranty (PPW) or Premium Payment Condition (PPC) due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, payment of premium by telegraphic transfer or any other relevant electronic settlement method on the next working day will be deemed to be in compliance with such PPW or PPC. |


Where (Re)Insurers have agreed to regular (weekly/ monthly/ quarterly) accounting the Premium Payment Warranty (PPW) or Premium Payment Condition (PPC) due date shall be overridden by the accounting agreement.

|  |  |
| NOTICE OF CANCELLATION PROVISIONS: | Where (re)insurers have the right to give notice of cancellation, in accordance with the provisions of the contract, then    To the extent provided by the contract, the Contract Leader is authorised to issue such notice on behalf of all participating (re)insurers; and (optionally)    Any (re)insurer may issue such notice in respect of its own participation.    The content and format of any such notice should be in accordance with the ‘Notice of Cancellation’ (NOC) standard, as published by the London Market Group (LMG), or their successor body, on behalf of London Market Associations and participants. However failure to comply with this standard will not affect the validity of the notice given.    The notice shall be provided to Solstice Agencies by an email to noc@solsticeagencies.com.    Failure to comply with this delivery requirement will make the notice null and void. Satisfactory delivery of the notice will cause it to be effective irrespective of whether Solstice Agencies has acknowledged receipt. |
